    <P>
      Each of us lives dependent and bound by our individual knowledge<br />
      and our awareness, all that...is what we call reality<br />
      however one's reality might be another illusion.

    <h3>Best words of l:</h3>
    <p>
      "There are many types of monsters in this world.
       Monsters who will not show themselves and who cause trouble;
       monsters who abduct children; monsters who devour dreams;
       monsters who suck blood, and... monsters who always tell lies.
       Lying monsters are a real nuisance.
       They are much more cunning than other monsters.
       They pose as humans even though they have no understanding of the human heart.
       They eat even though they've never experienced hunger.
       They study even though they have no interest in academics.
       They seek friendship even though they do not know how to love.
       If I were to encounter such a monster, I would likely be eaten by it.
       Because in truth, I am that monster."

    <h3>Best words of byakuya:</h3>
    <p id=byakuya>
      byakuya:Criminals must be brought to justice,<br>
      once their punishment is decided, it must be carried out,<br>
      that is the law.<br>
      No one:you honour the law even over the life of your own sister.<br>
      byakuya:sympathy towards a relative.. what could be more pointless.<br>
      feelings and emotions have no value compared to the law,<br>
      luckly i've never been burdened by such useless sentiments.<br>
      The kuchuki clan is one of the four great noble families,<br>
      we are duty bound to be examples of all soul reapers,<br>
      how can we enforce our laws , if we ourselves not obey them.
